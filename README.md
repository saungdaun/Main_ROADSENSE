🚧 RoadSenseBasic

An Android-based field survey system for digitizing Pavement Condition Index (PCI) and Surface Distress Index (SDI) evaluation toward scalable Pavement Management Systems (PMS).

A field-ready prototype for mobile road condition assessment and Pavement Management System (PMS) research.  
Built as a foundation toward scalable digital pavement management solutions.

🌍 Why This Project Matters

Road infrastructure monitoring in many developing regions still relies on manual surveys and fragmented reporting systems.

RoadSenseBasic provides a lightweight, mobile-first digital solution for:

- Pavement Condition Index (PCI) calculation
- Surface Distress Index (SDI) evaluation
- Road segment-based condition tracking
- Field survey digitization

This project serves as a prototype toward a smarter and more scalable Pavement Management System (PMS).



📌 Key Features

1️⃣ GPS-Based Road Survey
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Road segment mapping
- Continuous foreground tracking service

2️⃣ Surface & Distress Recording
- Surface distribution (Asphalt / Concrete)
- Segment-based condition classification
- Photo documentation per STA

3️⃣ Automated PCI Engineering Output
- PCI score (0–100 scale)
- Condition categorization
- Recommended treatment logic
- Segment-level breakdown
- PDF export capability

🧠 Core Strengths
- Field-ready architecture designed for real-time survey workflow
- Modular PCI & SDI computation engine
- Database schema versioning for data consistency
- Clear separation between UI, domain logic, and persistence layer



📘 Engineering Context

The Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method is widely used to assess road surface performance based on distress type, severity, and density.  
This application digitizes the evaluation process and integrates it with segment-based road tracking and automated computation.
